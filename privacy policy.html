</p>

<p>
This Privacy Policy forms part of the Terms of Use for the Services. Capitalized terms used but undefined here shall

We present aggregated statistics to advertisers without revealing personally identifiable information. Third-party advertising companies may use non-identifiable information to serve ads.

We strive to provide users access to their personal information upon request and correct inaccurate or deficient data.

Deleted information may persist in backup systems for some time.

<h2>Information Security</h2>

We implement security measures such as encryption, firewalls, and restricted server access to protect personal data.
